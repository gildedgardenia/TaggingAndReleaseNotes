This is an activity to practice tagging releases and compiling release notes. Each team member should put together three releases: one major, one minor, and one patch. Each release should be tagged using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

For each team member listed:
1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Make a PR for your major release. This should just include the word "MAJOR" being added to your spot in the codebase.
1. Await approval and then merge.
1. Make a PR for your minor release. This should just include the word "MINOR" being added to your spot in the codebase.
1. Await approval and then merge.
1. Make a PR for your patch release. This should just include the word "PATCH" being added to your spot in the codebase.
1. Await approval and then merge.

Your code should be appropriately tagged with the correct version and the release notes should be updated for each release.
